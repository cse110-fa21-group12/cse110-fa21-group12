Technical Story: Decide on code style

## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.}

We had to decide what code style we wanted to use in our app in order to ensure that our code is cohesive and clear. We wanted to decide this before we started coding our app so that we didn’t have to go back later and revise a lot of code at once; instead, we could simply format it as we go.

## Decision Drivers

* Easy to use
* Use with multiple languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
* Formats code cleanly

## Considered Options

* JS-CSS-HTML VSCode Extension
* Air-BnB Style Guidelines
* Google Style Guidelines
* Standard JS
* Babel VSCode Extension
* Prettier VSCode Extension

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Prettier, because it is easy to use for everyone since in is a VSCode extension, can format all of the necessary languages of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and formats code cleanly. 

### Positive Consequences 

* We can use Prettier with all of the languages we are using, which makes styling code very easy
* It is very quick to use a command with Prettier to format code as we write it

### Negative Consequences

* Sometimes doesn’t work with Live Share
