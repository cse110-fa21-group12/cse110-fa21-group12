#this is the minute s of the meeting for the kickoff meeting on Thursday 10/14/2021
Q. I'm unsure of how to structure my team's meeting minutes

A. Search online for examples of "Meeting minutes", you'll want to make sure to include

Team number / team name
Type of meeting held
Which members are present / absent
When & Where the meeting was held
The agenda of what is discussed
Any old unresolved business from the previous meeting
Any new business to be discussed
Anything that was on the agenda but was not discussed (save for next meeting's old business)
Any decisions made & their reasoning (if there were dissenting opinions include them, then write why the group decided to make that decision anyways)
When the meeting finished
