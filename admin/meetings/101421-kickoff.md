## Decisions Made & Reasoning
- We decided to call our team ZEN since we're Team 12, and 12 is a doZEN
- We decided to use a bluish gray color for our team branding because it's a calm color, reflecting ZEN, and many of us like the color blue
- We decided to have a simple logo design, which also reflects our ZEN state of mind
- Rajdeep will finish designing the logo since he found some concept designs everyone liked
- Jack will start making the team page since he volunteered to
