## Agenda

1. Discuss how we've been working and any problems we faced (We work well as a team, but we have trouble finding times to meet and work on the project synchronously. Also, consistent communication on Slack could be improved and the use of the project board)
2. Discuss how we can improve our work for next sprint (Hypothetically, we could try to plan out meetings further in advance instead of asking the day of when people are free, and make sure people have their Slack notifications turned on. We can also be more on top of adding issues to the project board as they come up)
