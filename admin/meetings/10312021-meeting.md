## To Be Discussed Next Meeting

## Decisions Made & Reasoning
- We decided to split up the work for the project pitch so we could work asynchronously
- We decided to get the project pitch done by tonight and give updates on our work through Slack
- We decided to make the project pitch in the form of a presentation because we thought that would be the simplest method instead of a PDF or markdown
- We decided that one person from each sub-team would work on their team's project timeline
