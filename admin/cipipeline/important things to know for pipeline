###ESLint
In case the action fails it might be because you need to install ESLint locally.
You have to have eslint locally installed for the action to work.

###Prettier
It's better if we all use the prettier extenstion too so it formats the our code locally and then the same action can be run in github to recheck the code style.

###Codacy
This app checks for code style and is already linked to our repo and you can check potential bugs in your code.
